# Social Sentry PC

**Reclaim your attention. Master your digital life.**

Social Sentry PC is a powerful, native Windows application designed for digital well-being, parental control, and high-performance productivity monitoring.

## 🔥 Key Features

### 🕶️ Stealth Mode (New!)
Social Sentry is designed to run silently without cluttering your workspace.
-   **Minimize to Tray**: Closing the main window (clicking 'X') will hide the application to the System Tray, keeping it accessible.
-   **Complete Stealth**: To remove the icon from the tray while keeping the protection active, right-click the Tray Icon and select **"Exit"**. The application will enter **Stealth Mode**—running invisibly in the background to continue monitoring and blocking without any visual trace.

### 🏥 Safety & Eye Health
Prevent digital eye strain and burnout with our automated safety system.
-   **50/30 Rule**: After **50 minutes** of continuous computer usage, Social Sentry enforces a **30-second break**.
-   **Break Overlay**: A full-screen overlay blocks interaction, encouraging you to look away and rest your eyes.
